 * Every fixture is parsed through the SAME zod schema the HTTP client uses, so
 * a fixture that drifts from the contract fails here, not in front of a user —
 * and swapping to the real backend is a config change, never a data-shape one.
 *
 * The content is real Companies Act, 2013 doctrine (s.96 AGM timing, s.173
 * board-meeting cadence, s.203 KMP, s.149(3) resident director) with a
 * genuine abstention: the FY2025-26 AGM outer date turns on the unsettled
 * G.S.R. 880(E) small-company threshold, so that row is APPLIES_UNDETERMINED
 * rather than a fabricated date. Nothing here invents a statutory figure.
